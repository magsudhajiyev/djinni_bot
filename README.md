# djinni_bot
Bot script for Djinni.co web site

In order to use the script make sure you copy your CV url from the HTML tree and placing it in config.json file. Also make sure to use one keyword to search at a time.
This script will be improved in future for extended functionalities. Right now it does not support multi keyword search and it does not memorize the applied jobs so be
aware of applying a job in multiple times.
